== Introduction

CoinBook is a desktop application that is made for users who prefer to work on a mouse-free, command line platform with minimal [gloss]#<<gui,graphical user interface (GUI)>># dependence.

Coinbook allows you to store a portfolio of your cryptocurrency purchases as well as track the latest price trends and news, in addition to providing various
tools to simplify and expedite your management process such as profit calculation.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
You can obtain the latest version http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here] (Download JRE).
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CoinBook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. (Fig. 1)
+
.Startup Window

+
.  Type your commands in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all Coins
* *`buy`*`BTC 3` : adds 3 coins to the BTC account
* *`view`*`BTC` : view the details of the BTC account
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Alternatively, you can type replace commands by their aliases which are shorter to achieve the same effect. For example:

* *`l`* : lists all accounts

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command. Command aliases are specified after the `/` symbol.

[[Features]]
== Features

.Command Format
****
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g. in `find NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter wh1ich can be used as `find ETH`.
* Options in square brackets are optional. e.g `NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `BTC t/fav` or as `BTC`.
* Options with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/cheap`, `t/active t/fav` etc.
* If an option without `...` is used multiple times, only the latest one will be used.
* Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `t/TAG a/VALUE`, `a/VALUE t/TAG` is also acceptable.
* Items in curly braces indicate multiple possibilities. e.g. `buy {NAME, TAG} AMOUNT`, is a command where the first parameter can either be a NAME or a TAG.
